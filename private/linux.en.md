# Why do we you Linux?

### Security and privacy
No mandatory activation or registration. There are practically no viruses for Linux.


### Flexibility and choices
We chose intuitive environment and [applications](/en/aplikace) that are needed for everyday work with the Internet and electronic documents. We installed a system that will be sustainable even on several dozen computers in the library.

### Economic reasons
Linux is an open source. Linux is free and runs on older and weaker computers.
