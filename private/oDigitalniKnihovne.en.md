# About digital library

In the Digital library you can find monographs, periodicals, manuscripts, maps, recordings, archivalias, sheetmusic or graphics.

The basic division of document:

* __public documents__ - these are works in the public domain. They are not subject to author’s or publisher’s rights. They are freely accessible
* __private documents__ - these are copyright works. They are protected by author’s or publisher’s rights (the duration of a copyright spans the author's life plus 70 years and 50 years from publishing); you can read them via this [browser] (but you cannot download and print)

__Questions and comments:__ if you have any questions or comment please let us know on kramerius@mzk.cz.
